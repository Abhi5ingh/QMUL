Instructions for running the ICV_Coursework 2 submission notebook:

I used the Google Colab environment to run these files, with all the relevant modules and libraries loaded.
I urge you to please run the notebook on Google Colab environment only. 

Running Instructions:
1) I have attached the dataset used for this task in the zip file, kindly import/load these files in the /content folder in colab.
(Image used for the task and the imagenet-labels json file)
2) All the libraries and modules are present just run the notebook.
3) Certain metric evaluations have been commented out because their computational complexity required more than 12 GB RAM,
for which I used Colab Pro.
